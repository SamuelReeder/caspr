<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction
This project is a web application designed to allow users to explore and interact with complex causal diagrams in a 3D environment. It helps visualize relationships between variables in systems with many interdependent factors. This tool can be leveraged across many domains of research including machine learning, economics, enviornmental, politics, and more. The application also includes a user management system for easy login, logout, and diagram saving. To summarize, key features include: 

### Key Features
- **Dynamic 3D Graph Visualization**: Our app brings causal diagrams to life! The 3D graph is generated dynamically from JSON data, where each node and edge represents crucial connections between elements. You can explore complex systems with ease.

- **Smooth Graph Interaction**: Navigate the graph in a fully immersive 3D space. Zoom, pan, and rotate the graph freely to explore relationships from every angle. It's simple and intuitive, letting you focus on discovering insights.

- **Node and Edge Information on Hover**: Curious about a specific node or edge? Just hover over it to see all the details, including node labels, categories, and edge relationships and strengths.

- **Powerful Filtering and Searching**: Customize your view with filtering based on connection strength, or search for nodes by name, category, or ID. The graph instantly adjusts to show exactly what you need.

- **Connection Type and Direction Indicators**: Easily differentiate between causal and inhibitory connections using color-coded edges (black for causal, red for inhibitory), and follow the arrows to see the direction of influence between nodes.
