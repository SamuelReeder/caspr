<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction
This project is a web application designed to allow users to explore and interact with complex causal diagrams in a 3D environment. It helps visualize relationships between variables in systems with many interdependent factors. This tool can be leveraged across many domains of research including machine learning, economics, enviornmental, politics, and more. The application also includes a user management system for easy login, logout, and diagram saving. To summarize, key features include: 
- **3D Visualization of Causal Diagrams**: Users can interact with and explore complex cause-and-effect diagrams in a three-dimensional space.
- **Interactive Features**: Includes zooming, rotating, and highlighting to focus on specific parts of the diagrams.
- **User Management System**: Allows users to save their diagrams and access them through a login system.
