# Team 19, Null Pointers

> _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.

> _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

* When: Monday Nov 11, 2024 @ 5:00 PM
* Where: Online, Team Discord Server

## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. What worked well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.

* A well-structured communication system allows team members to receive quick updates for outstanding tasks, blockers, or any project-related details. Notably, the use of a central communication platform (Discord) has been very beneficial. For example, the separation of channels (PR Reviews, Dev, Communication with Partner, etc.) segregates conversations into relevant topics. As a result, team members are directed to more organized spaces to ask/answer specific questions. To search for any previously asked questions or conversations, team members refer to the appropriate channel.

* Tracking TODOs with a Trello Board has allowed us to effectively manage feature completion requirements and ensure no tasks are left unaddressed. If each individual only keeps track of their own work, conflicts merge, and confusion can easily arise. With the use of a Trello board, tickets (feature updates, bug fixes, coursework) are added and track any remaining work. While we could have been more effective in leveraging the ticketing system, the use of [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/66ed6634a3dd6b5306980b5c/ATTI2153442630a9469bbd8b1bf633976857173847BA/null-pointers) still enabled the team to define expectations.

#### Q2. What did not work well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that did not work well.

* A lack of specificity in task assignments or expectations sometimes led to disorganization within the team. We tended to give team members moderate freedom in selecting and working on tasks from a central pool, but this did not come without some consequences. Members occasionally worked on the same tickets due to oversight resulting from this lack of ultrastrict assignments on our Trello board. Moreover, when the objectives or expectations of a task were not extremely specific, the team would sometimes unknowingly produce partial work. Instances of these are uncommon and do little to hinder us; however, it is clear that strictness and specificity increase our throughput.

* A lack of micro deadlines also contributed to inefficiencies, leading to last-minute rushes and unnecessary stress. Without clear intermediary milestones, tasks were often pushed closer to the final deadlines, adding to the stress and rush during review, revisions, and merging. This significantly increased the pressure on team members during these crucial moments. Introducing micro deadlines could help distribute the workload more evenly and ensure better time management across the team.

#### Q3(a). Planned changes

* We plan to be more strict with assigning tickets on Trello. Instead of assigning multiple people on the same ticket, we're going to make sure we only assign one person per ticket to ensure that only one person will work on a certain task.
* We plan to be more specific when assigning tasks to team members. Specifically, we're going to make the Trello tickets more detailed, explaining exactly what task needs to be done, possibly broken up into smaller tasks if needed. This will help solve issues where team members are producing partial work and may also help fix the issue with multiple people working on the same task.
* We plan to be more consistent with our standup updates, as there are some days where our team forgets to make standup updates. The more consistent standup updates will further ensure that everyone knows what they are going to be doing and that no one is doing the same task.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps

* In terms of integrating and combining each sub-teams' work from D2, our team benefitted from having split off the work such that there were minimal conflicts between sub-teams.
* We had one meeting focused on merging sub-team branches into main and collaboratively fixed conflicts. Larger conflicts were solved on separate branches by the individuals involved and pulled into main later on.
* The assignment was helpful in that the sub-teams got to focus on one particular aspect of the app only, allowing full attention to be given.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

* **Demo prep:** In preparation for the demo, our team assigned members to speak on the parts of the application they were primarily responsible for. For instance, Samuel, Danny, and Terry covered our backend, database, and infrastructure changes. Jaeyong and Kevin covered frontend changes along with the new pages and functionality they bring, including the "shared with me" and "explore graphs" pages. Daria and Morris spoke about the graph visualization page and the progress made there.

* **What we demoed:** Our team was able to demonstrate essentially every aspect of the MVP we outlined a couple of weeks prior. Our app runs smoothly and features a modern UI with all the essential home, explore, and shared with me pages implemented and functioning well. We demonstrated the sharing feature of the graphs and showed off the greatly improved graph visualization page. All aspects of the app were working together cohesively, and no feature lived on a separate branch.

* **Partner feedback:** Our partner accepted all features. Our partner requested that our search functionality be able to search for graphs not based just on their titles and descriptions, but also on the actual content within the graphs themselves.

* **Lessons learned:** We learned that giving a product demo is a task that requires diligent planning and preparation. If not done with proper planning, demos can be hard to follow and generally confusing for not just the audience, but also for the members giving the demo. We learned the importance of thoroughly testing the product and having a well-thought-out flow. From a product perspective, we learned that constant iteration, suggestion implementation, and improvement are standard. We learned the importance of being open-minded to suggestions and seeking them out regularly.
