# Deliverable 2 - Project Report - Team 19 Null Pointers

### 1. Summary of our software:
Our software is a web application that will enable users to three-dimensionally visualize, thoroughly explore, and interact with complex causal diagrams by means of a set of features including interactive information display, zoom, rotation, and highlighting. The application will feature a user management system for seamless login/logout, graph uploading/saving, as well as sharing graphs with other users. 

This application aims to tackle a prominent issue in the world of machine learning and data science research: the challenging task of visualizing complex causal relationships, particularly those involving several hundred nodes and edges. The goal is to neatly visualize the relationships between several variables or factors in a system, showing how they influence one another, while also allowing users to extract relevant information. The application will be particularly useful for understanding intricate systems where variables are interdependent and can have non-linear relationships with multiple layers of causality. This project has applications across several domains including economics, environment studies, political sciences, etc. Possible use cases include exploring how political policy changes can influence the broader economy, or how variables like carbon emissions, temperature rise, and deforestation can impact climate change models. 

We are working with the Machine Learning Group, a research group within the University of Toronto’s Department of Computer Science. We are collaborating directly with research lead Sheldon Huang and software lead Yuchen Wang.

### 2. Project Division
While a simple “frontend, backend, and data” subteam division was thoroughly considered for this deliverable, our team quickly realized that due to the nature of our application, there would be a significant number of issues that could arise in terms of overlap and blockers. To ensure the most efficient and hassle-free workflow, we decided to divide the project by key features such that overlap and potential for blockers is minimized. We divided the project into three parts as follows. Subteam 1 is responsible for the frontend, backend logic, and database setup required for all user account functionality (login, logout, account creation, password reset), as well as building the JSON file upload feature which allows users to upload data to be visualized into graphs. Subteam 2 will be responsible for building the 3D graph visualization page, which includes zoom, pan, rotation, node and edge information viewing, connection strength filtering and node search functionality. Subteam 3 will develop the frontend and backend required for graph searching functionality and graph sharing, which allows users to search for publicly available graphs uploaded into the application’s central database and share their own uploaded graphs with other users. 

We believed that this split was optimal for several reasons. First, it minimizes dependencies between teams. Each subteam can work relatively independently, reducing the need for constant coordination and the risk of one team blocking another. For example, Subteam 2, focusing on graph visualization, can proceed with developing the core visualization features without waiting for the user authentication system to be fully implemented by Subteam 1.

Second, this division aligns with the expertise and interests of our team members. We were able to form subteams where individuals had a strong interest and prior experience in the assigned features. This fostered a sense of ownership and motivation within each subteam. For example, Daria expressed interest in working on the frontend, so she was happy to tackle the graph visualization page for subteam 2. On the other hand, Samuel’s backend development experience and Firebase platform expertise was important for subteam 1.

Finally, this structure enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application in the long run. By dividing the project based on features, we create more modular and independent components. This makes it easier to update, debug, and extend specific features in the future without affecting other parts of the application.

### 3. Parts each sub team is responsible for:

#### **Subteam 1 component:**
Subteam 1 is responsible for developing the frontend and backend functionalities that handle user authentication, account management, and the ability to upload JSON node files to their account. These features include allowing users to create accounts using both email/password and Google, the corresponding frontend page for creating the account and forgot password page, and the login functionalities. In addition, subteam 1 is responsible for creating the feature of account recovery through password reset. This will all require the creation of several frontend React pages and the thorough setup and use of the Firebase API and Firestore database.

#### **Subteam 2 component:**
Subteam 2 is responsible for developing the frontend for the graph page that allows users to interactively visualize the graph given the JSON data. Key functionalities include zooming, panning, and rotating the graph in the 3D workspace. Users can hover over nodes and edges to view detailed information and metadata, filter causal connections by strength, search for nodes by name, category, or ID, and identify the type of connection (causal or inhibitory) along with its direction. Additionally, users can create multiple tabs for different configurations of data visualization. This will require the development of a React page using Three.js and D3 technologies to enable graph visualization.

#### **Subteam 3 component:**
Subteam 3 is responsible for developing the frontend and backend functionalities that handle graph searching and graph sharing within the application’s central database. These features allow users to search for a publicly available graph other users have uploaded into our application’s database. Search functionalities mainly include searching by name, and other functionalities include searching by description, author, and other graph metadata. Additionally, users will be able to share their graphs with other users and be able to set certain editing permissions for each user they share with (this will be done later once we merge everything, as there are dependencies from each user story for this functionality).
