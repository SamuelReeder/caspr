## Introduction

Subteam 1 is responsible for the frontend, backend logic, and database setup required for all user account functionality (login, logout, account creation, password reset), as well as building the JSON file upload feature which allows users to upload data to be visualized into graphs. For each of these components, our team has written ample unit tests to ensure working basic functionality. Our work includes:

- A home page where users can view their saved graphs (fetched from firebase), upload more JSON files, or logout
- Ability for users to create an account, login (with option to do both via Google), and change their password
- Complete set-up and thorough use of Firebase APIs and Firestore DB
